Hey y'all. 

I'm James David Long. 

This is my work account for Palomar Speciality where I serve as EVP of Innovation. 

My personal github account is https://github.com/CerebralMastication. I don't produce a lot of public code, but you can find the source code to my book, R Cookbook, 2nd Edition on github: https://github.com/CerebralMastication/R-Cookbook
